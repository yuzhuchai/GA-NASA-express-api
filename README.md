# NASA-express-api


users can load up the home page and see a NASA picture of the day with descriptions. and a login/register window
users need to register and login.
when user register, they can 'adopt' a Kepler planet by entering a number and a letter, or by choosing from a provided list, browse planets?
the planet will be living in the background of the app, users can add/edit their own descriptions to the existing minimal info(fetched from NASA planet api) about the planet.
users need to occasionally go play with the planet to keep it alive (like tamagotchi, but the planet only gets sad if users don't interact with it.)
users interact with the planet directly by hitting a button or by posting/saving posts on the app (detailed below).

users can delete the planet, see more detailed info about the planet, post the planet status.

users can find a drop down menu with categories including most of the NASA open source api data like space weather, near earth objects, Mars projects.....
users can choose the category and enter the info they want to see or just get some random data.
the app will fetch the data from NASA api and translate it into a non-programmer readable paragraph/photo.
users can save the data/info/paragraph that the get from the request(only they can see it).
users can add comment to the info they got back(will not post to their home page if they dont want to).
users can repost the data/info/paragraph to their home page.
other users can comment, like, save the data/info/paragraph posted on users home page.
